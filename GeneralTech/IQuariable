IQueryable is an interface that plays a crucial role in LINQ (Language Integrated Query). Itâ€™s specifically designed for querying data from various sources. Here are the key points:

Inheritance: IQueryable inherits from IEnumerable<T>. This means it extends the functionality provided by IEnumerable<T>.
Queryable Collection: IQueryable represents a queryable collection of data. Itâ€™s commonly used for querying databases (e.g., SQL databases) or in-memory collections (like List<T>).
Deferred Execution: Unlike IEnumerable<T>, where queries are executed immediately, IQueryable<T> builds a query expression that isnâ€™t executed until explicitly invoked. This deferred execution allows for more efficient query optimization.
Expression Trees: IQueryable<T> introduces expression trees. These trees represent the query operations as expressions, which can be translated into the underlying data sourceâ€™s query language (e.g., SQL).
In summary, IQueryable provides powerful querying capabilities, especially when dealing with complex data sources. Itâ€™s a great choice when you need to compose and execute queries efficiently! ðŸ˜Š
