   this one Ã¬s to find minimum range that will contain at least 1 element from a k sorted arrays of numbers 
   the same question is the question of facilities in a boat and find the perfect place to stay so we will need the least moves to get to all the facilities 
   in the second version each facility is a list with flor location 
   the algorism is 
   1. sort the arrays if they are not sorted 
   2. start with index 0 of all the list and get the minimum 
   3. calculate the difference between the min and the max (of the location 0 which is the min of the specific list)
   4. after recording the deference move the pointer to the next element of the min found 
   5. continue until one of the list ends 
       0,2,3,4,20
       5,6,7
       10,11,12,13,14

       so we start with 0,5,10 and advance the pointer at 0 the range is 0...10
       next is 2,5,10 -> 3,5,10 -> 4,5,10 -> 20,5,10->20,6,10->20,7,10 then we should peek 7 next but there is none 
       the best is 4...10

       for the coding we can choose PriorityQueue (min-heap) that will get us the next min if we enqueue the numbers in the deferent arrays and will pop them in order ,
