prefer scripts in header with src (it will be cached in the browser and we can use cdm)
when adding js for the page we prefer puting that in the header with $(document).ready() so it will load only after the page is fully loaded giving a faster expireince 

using bootstrap (a css framework to make the html looks nicer)
