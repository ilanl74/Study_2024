Scrum Events: Scrum prescribes four key events to ensure regular inspection and adaptation:

Sprint: A time-boxed iteration, usually 2-4 weeks, during which a potentially shippable product increment is created.

Sprint Planning: A meeting at the start of the sprint where the team plans the work they will do.

Daily Scrum: A 15-minute stand-up meeting for the development team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

Sprint Review: A meeting at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed.

Sprint Retrospective: A meeting after the sprint review to reflect on the sprint and plan ways to improve in the next sprint.
