    this chart focus on the -> who , what , when 
    it does not focus on the how 
    it mast have one flow direction from left to right 
    arrows from the right border of the box to the left border of the box (not the top or bottom)
    the x axis shows the flow 
    the y axis shows the actors (the who) and they can level up and down 
    be sure not to have too many boxes on the same actor sequentially 
    steps to create the chart 
        1. define your purpose (the why)
        2. identify tasks 
        3. format task by type 
        4. draw chart 
        5. confirm the flow chart
