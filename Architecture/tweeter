Client to Server:
When you post a tweet, the client app sends it to the server via REST API.
The server processes the tweet and stores it in the database.
Server to Message Broker:
The server sends the tweet to a message broker (e.g., Kafka) for real-time processing.
The message broker distributes the tweet to various services like timeline generation and notifications.
Server to WebSocket:
WebSockets are used to push real-time updates to clients, such as new tweets or notifications.
Microservices Communication:
Microservices handle tasks like user authentication, tweet processing, and analytics.
They communicate using REST APIs or message brokers to ensure scalability and reliability.
Hereâ€™s a simple diagram to visualize the communication flow:

Client <--> Server <--> Message Broker <--> WebSocket
   |            |              |                |
   |            |              |                |
Microservices <--> Server <--> Message Broker <--> WebSocket
