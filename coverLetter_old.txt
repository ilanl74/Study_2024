I have been working in Retail for the last 12 years, 
focusing on both maintenance and development tasks. 
I believe my experience could be beneficial to Nayax. 


I am ready for my next challenge, 
with strong base of Solid and OOP. 
I am looking forward to learning new technologies and bring rich experience to the team.

Ready for my next challenge.
I see my main added value,
in the ability to harness people to work together, and achieve common goals. 
Making sure to remove any obstacles.
And finding the most cost-effective action points for improvement.
