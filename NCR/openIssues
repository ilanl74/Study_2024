Lpe optimization types (best  deal , groups , ...)

no double deep

best deal - 5 coke  
    p0 parent promotion on coke 
    p1 1$ on 1 coke 
    p2 3$ on every 2 coke 
    p2 wins since 6$ is best over 5$

item contribution - 5 coke 
    p1 1$ on 1 coke 
    p2 3$ on every 2 coke 
    p2 wins since 6$/4 is better then 1$/1 and in the second round left 1 coke with 1$ discount so all together 7$ discount 

item contribution - item a,b
    p1 condition a or b 1$ discount 1$/1 for a and for b 
    p2 condition a or b threshold 2 discount 3$ a by itself contribution is 0 so is b 
    so p2 is not in the conflict since a contribution is 0 on both items and the total discount is 2$ for p1 and 3$ for p2 

all permutation 
    looks for all the available combination and in a,b scenario p2 wins 3$ discount 
    in 5 coke 7$ discount 2 p2 and 1 p1
    for 20 items and 20 promotions the combination could be 2 pow 20 1m

groups 
    define groups of promotions in which 1 promotion can win in a group 
    there is a scenario in which the same item appear in 2 groups and it will cause double deep (tow discounts on the same item)



second motivation is to prevent incentive to split the basket 
    like the 3 books cheapest for free 
    b1 5$ b2 4$ b3 3$ b4 2$ - the discount should be 3$
