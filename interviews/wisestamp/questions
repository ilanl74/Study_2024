1. are you still saying hi to bob (hibob) or you already said bye to bob
2. where is the business (sorry for the question but i did not understand why should I subscribe for email signature and pay monthly )
signature analytics - never thought about it (is that referring clicking a link in the mail signature  )
liked the campaign function 
did not understand the custom directory sync 
when enabling employee change , does it involve management approval (for the specific editing text and ...)
* is it saas product , are all tenants sharing the same url endpoint 
* the pricing is very low so you mast have a lot of customers to support the activity 
* there is a defect in pricing - when opening the site in low resolution the enterprise alt is jumping and horizontal scroll that cannot be functional 
* audit log alt is not clear 
* embedded image or liked image with cdn google drive ....

** what about the rival exclaimer,brandmail,code two email signature (overall in comparison failing on value for mony and customer service)

* are you working on CRM connectivity (sap , sailsforce )

can we use pacebook and other network to add the signature to their pages ? (not from the email side )

do we have standard way for onboarding (importing the employee data like names address phone num position ,department etc )
