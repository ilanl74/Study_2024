each middleware is wrapping its followers.

in middleware do work that change the response only before the next(context) call 

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        var branchVer = context.Request.Query["branch"];
        logger.LogInformation("Branch used = {branchVer}", branchVer);

        // Do work that doesn't write to the Response.
        await next();
        // Do other work that doesn't write to the Response.
    });
